# Learning goals

* Explain how machine learning fits into the larger picture of building and maintaining production systems
* Describe the typical components relating to AI in an AI-enabled system and typical design decisions to be made

# AI-Enabled Systems

----
## Whole System Perspective

* A model is just one component of a larger system
* Also pipeline to build the model
* Also infrastructure to deploy, update, and serve the model
* Integrating the model with the rest of the system functionality
* User interaction design, dealing with mistakes
* Overall system goals vs model goals

*let's look at a couple of examples*

----
## Thinking about Systems

* Holistic approach, looking at the larger picture, involving all stakeholders
* Looking at relationships and interactions among components and environments
    - Everything is interconnected
    - Combining parts creates something new with emergent behavior
    - Understand dynamics, be aware of feedback loops, actions have effects
* Understand how humans interact with the system

> A system is a set of inter-related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system's objective -- Donella Meadows

----
## System-Level Challenges for AI-Enabled Systems

* Getting and updating data, concept drift, changing requirements
* Handling massive amounts of data
* Interactions with the real world, feedback loops
* Lack of modularity of AI components, lack of specifications, nonlocal effects
* Deployment and maintenance
* Versioning, debugging and incremental improvement
* Keeping training and operating cost manageable
* Interdisciplinary teams
* Setting system goals, balancing stakeholders and requirements
* ...

**Examples?**

----
## On Terminology

* There is no standard term for referring to building systems with AI components
+ "AI-Enabled Systems", "ML-Enabled Systems" or "ML-Infused Systems"
+ SE4AI, SE4ML
+ sometimes AI engineering
+ sometimes ML Systems Engineering (but often this refers to building distributed and scalable ML learning and data storage platforms)
+ AIOps ~ using AI to make automated decisions in operations; DataOps ~ use of agile methods and automation in business data analytics; MLOps ~ technical infrastructure for operating AI-based products and on deploying updates
+ Developers with Software Engineering and ML skills were often referred to as "unicorns" in earlier days

# Components of an AI-Enabled System

(Using Hulten's Terminology)

<!-- references -->
* ðŸ•® Hulten, Geoff. "Building Intelligent Systems: A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering." (2018).

----
## Elements of an Intelligent System

* **Meaningful objective**: goals, requirements, business case
* **Intelligent experience**: user interactions -- presenting model predictions to users; user interactions; eliciting feedback, telemetry
* **Intelligence implementation**: infrastructure -- learning and serving the model and collecting feedback (telemetry)
* **Intelligence creation**: learning and evaluating models
* **Orchestration**: operations -- maintaining and updating the system over time, debugging, countering abuse

----
## Design Decisions for each Element?

<!-- colstart -->

* Meaningful objective
* Intelligent experience / user interaction design
* Intelligence implementation / infrastructure
* Intelligence creation
* Orchestration / operations

# User Interactions (Intelligent Experiences)

----
## Designing Intelligent Experiences

* How to use the output of a model's prediction (for a goal)?
* Design considerations:
    - How to present prediction to a user? Suggestions or automatically take actions?
    - How to effectively influence the user's behavior toward the system's goal?
    - How to minimize the consequences of flawed predictions?
    - How to collect data to continue to learn from users and mistakes?
* Balancing at least three outcomes:
    - Achieving goals
    - Protection from mistakes
    - Collecting data for training

----
## Forcefulness

* Forceful (hard to ignore or stop):
    * Automate an action 
    * Interrupt the user and ask for confirmation before they can continue
* Passive experience:
    - Prompt that does not require immediate answer 
    - Icon or information box making suggestion
    

**Examples?**

**When to chose which?**

----
## Modes of Interaction

* Automate
* Prompting
* Organizing information
* Annotate
* Hybrids

**Examples?**

Notes: Lots of examples in Hulten's book, Chapter 8

----
## Frequency

* Interact whenever a new prediction is available
* Interact when prediction changes significantly
* Hard limit on interaction frequency (e.g., max 1 prediction per hour)
* Interact based on anticipated user reaction; adaptive
* Interaction explicitly initiated by user

**Examples?**

*Consider notification fatigue vs missed opportunities to help vs learnability*

Note: Examples: Interact frequently during navigation or giving fitness instructions (whenever things change); fewer predictions after many ignored ones



----
## Factors to Consider

When designing an intelligent experience consider:

* Forcefulness: How strongly to encourage taking an action (or even automate it)?
* Frequency: How often to interact with the user?
* Value: How much does a user (think to) benefit from the prediction?
* Cost: What is the damage of a wrong prediction?
* Model quality: How often is the prediction wrong?

----
## Factors in Case Studies

Consider: forcefulness, frequency, value, cost, model quality

----
## Feedback (Telemetry)

* To design good interactions we need to know how we are doing...
* How many predictions are ignored?
* How many actions are reversed?
* How often does the user ask for extra predictions?
* How much value do users get out of predictions?
* How much are we supporting the system's goals?
* How much cost are wrong predictions causing for users/the system's goals?
* Are mistakes focused on specific kinds of inputs?


----
## Initial Telemetry Ideas?

Identify: usage, mistakes, cost of mistakes, benefits to user, benefits to goals

## The Smart Toaster

> the toaster may (occasionally) burn my toast, but should never burn down my kitchen

![Toaster](toaster.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


----
## Making the Smart Toaster Safe

Assume classification model:
$\text{continueToasting}(\text{camera}_\text{initial}, \text{camera}_\text{now}, \text{temperatureReading}, $
$ \text{userPref}) \rightarrow \text{Boolean}$

How to assure the toaster does not overhead?

<!-- discussion -->

----
## Safeguards / Guardrails

* Hard constraints overrule model
    - `heat = (temperatureReading < MAX) && continueToasting(...)`
* External hardware or software failsafe mechanisms
    - outside the model, external observer, e.g., thermal fuses


![A thermal fuse protecting the windings of a small motor](thermalfuse.png)

----
## Other Strategies

* Improve the model, more data, more testing
* Adjusting interaction models, e.g., involving users, confirmations
* Better hardware
* ...

**In all cases, look beyond model accuracy at the entire system**

# A System View on Intelligence Infrastructure

## Infrastructure for ML Components

![Plumming](plumming.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

This was 2015; many of those boxes are getting increasingly standardized these days.


Graphic from Sculley, et al. "[Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf)." In Proc NIPS, 2015.


Note: Even for a single ML component and it's pipeline, there is a lot of
infrastructure to build and serve the model.

----
## Thinking in Pipelines over Models

* In production systems, models need to be deployed and updated
* Consider the entire pipeline, not just the model
    - Quality assurance, reproduciblity, repeatability, debugging
    - Modifiability, agility
    - Training cost and scalability
    - Data availability, data wrangling cost
    - Telemetry
* Reported as one of the key challenges in production machine learning

# System Qualities vs Model Accuracy

----
## Systems have Goals

... selling stuff, increasing engagement, encouraging responsible behavior

Model predictions support those goals

**more next lecture**

----
## More Accurate Predictions may not be THAT Important

* "Good enough" may be good enough
* Prediction critical for system success or just an gimmick?
* Better predictions may come at excessive costs 
    - need way more data, much longer training times
    - privacy concerns
* Better user interface ("experience") may mitigate many problems
    - e.g. explain decisions to users
* Use only high-confidence predictions?


----
## Beyond Model Quality

Many other aspects of a model's quality may matter when operating a system

**Examples?**

<!-- discussion -->

(more later)

Notes:
Learning time, inference time,
incremental learning,
explainability,
model size,
kinds of mistakes,
fairness, privacy, security, robustness,
reproducibility,
maintainability
