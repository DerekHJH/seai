Artificial Intelligence: 

> computers acting humanly / thinking humanly / thinking rationally / acting rationally -- [Russel and Norvig, 2003](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991019419529704436)

Machine Learning:
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. -- [Tom Mitchell, 1997](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/1feg4j8/alma991003098569704436)

Deep Learning:

> specific learning technique based on neural networks


Note: Precise definitions are difficult to capture. Some simply describe AI as "everything that's hard in computer science".

# Machine Learning Overview

## Common Problem Classes

* Classification 
* Probability estimationÔºàclassificationËá™Â∏¶ÁöÑÔºâ
* Regression
* RankingÔºàRegressionËá™Â∏¶ÔºåÊØîÂ¶ÇÁî®regressionÈ¢ÑÊµãÂá∫‰∏Ä‰∫õÂàÜÊï∞ÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéËæìÂá∫ÂàÜÊï∞ÊúÄÈ´òÁöÑÈÇ£‰∏Ä‰∏™Ôºâ
* Hybrids

## Examples?

* Identifying whether there a scan shows cancer
* Detecting shoe brands in an image
* Predicting the sales price of a house
* Recommending videos on Youtube
* Understanding survival rates of titanic passengers
* Estimating the arrival time of a ride sharing car
* Transcribing an audio file
* Finding academic papers on economic fairness 

## Learning Paradigms

* Supervised learning -- labeled training data provided
* Unsupervised learning -- training data without labels
* Reinforcement learning -- agents learning from interacting with an environment

## Examples

* Identifying whether there a scan shows cancer
* Playing chess
* Predicting the sales price of a house
* Organizing books into topics
* Detecting shoe brands in an image
* Identifying unusual purchases from a credit card
* Learning to walk
* Transcribing an audio file

## Many Different Techniques

* Building on logic: Inductive reasoning

* Imitating brains: e.g., neural networks

* Imitating evolution: e.g., genetic programming

* Probabilities: e.g., Naive Bayes, Markov chains

* Finding analogies: e.g., nearest neighbor, SVM

* Reinforcement learning

# Neural Networks

## Deep Learning

* Layers with different numbers of neurons 
* Different kinds of connections
  - fully connected (feed forward)
  - not fully connected (eg. convolutional networks)
  - keeping state (eg. recurrent neural networks)
  - skipping layers
  - ...

## Reusing and Retraining Networks

* Incremental learning process enables continued training, retraining, incremental updates
* A model that captures key abstractions may be good starting point for adjustments (i.e., rather than starting with randomly initialized parameters)
* Reused models may inherit bias from original model
* LineageÔºàÂÆ∂Á≥ªÔºâ important. Model cards promoted for documenting rationale, e.g., [Google Perspective Toxicity Model](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/2-api/model-cards/English/toxicity.md)

## Deep Learning Discussion

* Too large and complex to understand what is learned, why, or how decisions are made (compare to decision trees)

# Classic Symbolic AI

(Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence)

## Boolean Satisfiability

Given a propositional formula over boolean variables, is there an assignment such that the formula evaluates to true?

$(a \vee b) \wedge (\neg a \vee c) \wedge \neg b$

decidable, np complete, lots of search heuristics

## Encoding Problems

![Toyota Car Configurator](toyotaconfig.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Configuration dialog. Some options are mutually exclusive. Some depend on other options. 


----
## Encoding Problems

![KConfig Screenshot](kconfig.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


----
## Linux KConfig

```python
config HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE
  def_bool n

# eventually, we can have this option just 'select SPARSEMEM'
config MEMORY_HOTPLUG
  bool "Allow for memory hot-add"
  depends on SPARSEMEM || X86_64_ACPI_NUMA
  depends on ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTPLUG
  select NUMA_KEEP_MEMINFO if NUMA

config MEMORY_HOTPLUG_SPARSE
  def_bool y
  depends on SPARSEMEM && MEMORY_HOTPLUG

config MEMORY_HOTPLUG_DEFAULT_ONLINE
  bool "Online the newly added memory blocks by default"
  depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
  help
    This option sets the default policy setting for memory hotplug
    onlining policy (/sys/devices/system/memory/auto_online_blocks) which
    determines what happens to newly added memory regions. Policy setting
    can always be changed at runtime.
    See Documentation/admin-guide/mm/memory-hotplug.rst for more information.

    Say Y here if you want all hot-plugged memory blocks to appear in
    'online' state by default.
    Say N here if you want the default policy to keep all hot-plugged
    memory blocks in 'offline' state.

config MEMORY_HOTREMOVE
  bool "Allow for memory hot remove"
  select MEMORY_ISOLATION
  select HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE if (X86_64 || PPC64)
  depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG && ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE
  depends on MIGRATION
```

## SAT Encoding

Describe configuration constraints:

<!-- colstart -->
```
config MEMORY_HOTPLUG
  bool "Allow for memory hot-add"
  depends on SPARSEMEM || X86_64_ACPI_NUMA
  depends on ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTPLUG
  select NUMA_KEEP_MEMINFO if NUMA
```
<!-- col -->
<!-- small -->
(MEMORY_HOTPLUG => SPARSEMEM || X86_64_ACPI_NUMA)

&&

(MEMORY_HOTPLUG => ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTPLUG)

&&

(MEMORY_HOTPLUG && NUMA => NUMA_KEEP_MEMINFO)

...
<!-- colend -->

----
## Automated Configuration Analysis

given configuration constraints $\phi$ :

**Which option can never be selected?**

`dead(o) = $\neg$SAT($\phi \wedge o$)`

**Which option must always be selected?**

`mandatory(o) = TAUT($\phi \Rightarrow o$)`

`= $\neg$SAT($\neg(\phi \Rightarrow o)$)`

`= $\neg$SAT($\phi \wedge \neg o$)`


**Any options that can never be selected together?**

`mutuallyExclusive(o, p) = ?`


----
## More Automated Configuration Analysis

given configuration constraints $\phi$ and already made selections of $a$ and $b$


**Which other options do need to be selected?**

`mustSelect(o) = ?`

----
## Constraint Satisfaction Problems, SMT

Generalization beyond boolean options, numbers, strings, additions, optimization

**Example: Job Scheduling**

Tasks for assembling a car: { t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6 }; values denoting start time

max 30 min: $\forall_n t_n<30$ 

t2 needs to be after t1, t1 takes 10 min: $t_1+10\le t_2$

t3 and t4 needs to be after t2, take 2 min: $(t_2+2\le t_3) \wedge (t_2+2\le t_4)$

t5 and t6 (5 min each) should not overlap: $(t_5+5\le t_6) \vee (t_6+5\le t_5)$

Goal: find valid assignment for all start times, or find valid assignment minimizing the latest start time

----
## General Observations

* Encoding of many problems
* Deductive reasoning, specifications! (no learning)
* Provides accurate answer (guarantees!), or timeout
* Provides concrete solution that is easy to check, possibly easy to understand (depends on encoding)
* np-complete, may take very long time to find answer
* Modern solvers are very good for many problems
* For optimization problems often good approximations exist (heuristic search)

----
## Modern Use Cases

* Planning, scheduling, logistics 
  * e.g., planning data center layout to minimize cable length
  * e.g., optimizing big data queries
  * e.g., scheduling shifts for employees based on preferences
* Static analysis, verification, security analysis of software
  - e.g., concolic testing, detecting buffer overflows
* Version resolution and dependency management 
  * e.g., Eclipse, Dart
* Combinatorial design
  * e.g., cryptography, crop rotation schedules, drug design
* Chip design and verification
  * e.g., equivalence checking
* Protein folding and other bioinformatics applications
* Electronic trading agents, e-auctions

## Probabilistic Programming by Example

```scala
val burglary = Flip(0.01)
val earthquake = Flip(0.0001)
val alarm = CPD(burglary, earthquake,
                  (false, false) -> Flip(0.001),
                  (false, true) -> Flip(0.1),
                  (true, false) -> Flip(0.9),
                  (true, true) -> Flip(0.99))
val johnCalls = CPD(alarm,
                  false -> Flip(0.01),
                  true -> Flip(0.7))

...
println("Probability of burglary: " + 
        alg.probability(burglary, true))
```

## Probabilistic Programming by Example

```scala
class Person {
  val smokes = Flip(0.6)
}
def smokingInfluence(pair: (Boolean, Boolean)) =
  if (pair._1 == pair._2) 3.0; else 1.0

val alice, bob, clara = new Person
val friends = List((alice, bob), (bob, clara))
clara.smokes.observe(true)
for { (p1, p2) <- friends } 
  ^^(p1.smokes, p2.smokes).setConstraint(smokingInfluence)

...
println("Probability of Alice smoking: " + 
        alg.probability(alice.smokes, true))
```

Note: Discussed in tutorial: https://www.cra.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Figaro_Tutorial.pdf

Source: https://github.com/p2t2/figaro/blob/master/FigaroExamples/src/main/scala/com/cra/figaro/example/Smokers.scala

## More Examples

see [GitHub p2t2/figaro](https://github.com/p2t2/figaro/tree/master/FigaroExamples/src/main/scala/com/cra/figaro/example) and many other languages

## Why Probabilistic Programming?

* Reasoning about uncertainly, at scale (simulations)
* Planning with uncertainty, making decisions with partial information
* Infer causes of events, likely explanations
* Expressed in the familiar and expressive form of a programming language, often with different reasoning engines in background
*
* Based on knowledge and logic

## Probabilistic Inference

Answering queries about probabilistic models

```scala
println("Probability of burglary: " + 
        alg.probability(burglary, true))

println("Probability of Alice smoking: " + 
        alg.probability(alice.smokes, true))
```

* Analytical probabilistic reasoning (e.g., variable elimination Bayes' rule) -- precise result, guarantees
* Approximation (e.g., belief propagation)
* Sampling (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo) -- probabilistic guarantees

## Example: Robot Path and Adaptation Planning

![Robot Path Map](robotmap.png)


## Example: Robot Path and Adaptation Planning
![Learning Models for Adaptations](brassmars.png)

![MAPE-K](mapek.png)

Notes:
Examples from a recent research project to reason about adaptations in robots, e.g., change which hardware to use or which route to take. We learn energy models and other models from observations, from which we know multiple plausible configurations with different tradeoffs (and certainty). To chose an optimal configuration, a probabilistic planner is used to make decisions at runtime.

## General Observations

* Manually created models
* Representing uncertainty
* Reasoning with probabilities, precise of with probabilistic bounds
* Deductive reasoning, specifications! 
* Inference is hard to scale
* Recently, commonly combined with machine learning
